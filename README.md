##More Scripts to come##

###Spotify###
Spotify script that helps automate the basic playing/pausing of songs.

Tested on Mac and Windows.

**NOTE:** The Volume Up/Down gestures might be reversed if the band is being worn upside down (i.e the "correct" way to wear it is to have the standard blue LED facing your body). This is a limitation of the Script API and how the readings come in.

######Features:######
1. **Play/Pause** - With "Fingers Spread" gesture
2. **Volume up/down** - With "Fists" gesture rotating left and right
3. **Next/Prev Track** - With "Wave in/out" gesture with your hands pointing left for previous track and right for next track
4. **Seek Forward/Backward** - With the "Wave in/out" gesture (same as #3) but held for half a second
